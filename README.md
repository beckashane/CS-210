// Module 7 Project 3 of C++ class SNHU

This C++ program is designed to track the frequency of items from an input file and provides a menu-driven interface to perform various operations related to the tracked data. 
The ItemTracker class is used to track the frequency of items in a text file. It contains a private member frequencyMap, which is a std::map that associates each unique item with its frequency.
The code Reads items from the file "CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt" and updates the frequency map. It opens the input file and reads items one by one and it updates the frequencyMap by incrementing the frequency count for each item.
The code Saves the frequency data to the file "frequency.dat.". It opens the output file and writes each item along with its frequency to the file.
The main creates an instance of ItemTracker and provides a menu for the user to interact with the frequency data.
The switch handles different menu options from the user. 

I learned a lot in this class. My previous coding experience mostly consisted of Python. While the concepts are all the same throughout different coding languages, C++ is much more detailed and more customizable compared to Python. The syntax is lengthier, but can perform better because of it. I thoroughly learned C++, it will be one of my main languages that I will continue to work with throughout my career. 

Thank you for this class.
